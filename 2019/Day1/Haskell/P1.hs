main :: IO ()
main = do

  --let numbers = map read (lines input)
  let numbers = [read x | x <- lines input] -- list comprehension
  --let results = map (\x -> (x `div` 3) - 2) numbers -- this is a lambda

This program uses the readFile function to read the contents of the input file into a string. It then uses the lines function to split the string into a list of strings, one for each line of the input file. The map function is used to convert each string into a number, and the resulting list of numbers is stored in the numbers variable.

Next, the map function is used again to apply the processing function to each number in the numbers list. This processing function divides each number by 3, rounds down, subtracts 2, and returns the result. The resulting list of processed numbers is stored in the results variable.

Finally, the foldl function is used to add up all the numbers in the results list, and the resulting sum is printed to the standard output using the putStrLn function.

This is just one possible way to solve this problem using Haskell. There are many other ways to approach this problem, and you may want to experiment with different approaches to see which one works best for you.
